# **Problem Statement:**

The Online Movie Ticket Booking System allows users to order tickets for a show and gather information about movies and venues. To purchase show tickets, the customer must first register at the location. When selecting a show, the user is presented with a seating configuration from which he can select seats. He'll be redirected to the payment input screen to create a group activity from there. The suggested application allows users to reserve a movie from a theatre for a specific time and location. The user can display their booking history as a theatre ticket, saving time and money.
